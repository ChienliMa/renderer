# Redenerer: 
    Personal implementation of Synthetic Data Generator.
    -Dependence: pygame, opencv, scipy;  Recommand System: OSX
    
    
Run the demo( example.py ) and you will find systhetic datas in the 'result' folder. Please note that the quality of results is highly depends of the qualites of fonts and background images.
